# [Strip Comments](https://www.codewars.com/kata/51c8e37cee245da6b40000bd)

Complete the solution so that it strips all text that follows any of a set of comment markers passed in. Any whitespace at the end of the line should also be stripped out.

## Examples

```javascript
solution("apples, pears # and bananas\ngrapes\nbananas !apples", ["#", "!"]); // "apples, pears\ngrapes\nbananas"
```
